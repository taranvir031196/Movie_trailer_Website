##				    MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE

This is my first Full Stack nanodegree project('MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE') which is used to generate list of movies in a webpage which is used to show the trailers of the movies defined.

##OVERVIEW-:
There are three files in which fresh_tomatoes.py is used to generate webpage containing the list of movies defined in entertainment_center.py.

### KEY FEATURES-:

1.Quick Start
2.What's there inside.
3.Functioning.

### QUICK START-:

In order to run the application follow the following steps-:

---> Download the code or the zip file to your machine and then extract it.

---> Now open the file in a text editor or open the terminal and then by going to the directory run command "python entertainment_center.py"

---> Your default browser would open and launch a new tab showing your "MOVIE TRAILER WEBSITE".

## WHAT's THERE INSIDE-:

---> entertainment_center.py - main Python script to run.

---> media.py - contains the class Movie that stores movie details.

---> fresh_tomatoes.py - creates the HTML file for the website (PROVIDED BY UDACITY)

##Functioning-:

--> In this project I have created a three files named- media.py,entertainment.py,fresh_tomatoes.py which is used to generate the the movie trailer website.

---> In media.py i have defined all the instance variables of the class Movie() which are used to generate the title,storyline,poster_image,youtube_trailer which is a main part of the website.

---> Now using the file media.py in entertaiment.py we define the instances of the class movie and then create a list used in fresh_tomatoes.py function named open_movies_page().

---> Now i have also made some changes to css of the file-fresh_tomatoes.py which is optional.

---> That's all is needed to be done in order to complete the movie trailer website project.
